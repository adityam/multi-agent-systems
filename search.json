The prisoners are kept in separate cells with no means to communicate. The prosecutors simultaneously offer the following bargain to both prisoners: serve as a witness that the other criminal committed the crime and walk free; unless the other also confesses in which case both get sentenced. If both criminals confess, both get a reduced sentenced for the main crime (2 years in prison). If only one confesses, the criminal who confessed walks free while the other gets a full sentence for the main crime (10 years in prison). If neither prisoner takes the bargain, then both get charged for the lesser crime (1 year in prison).\n\n\nThis example can be modeled as a two player game as follow. The action sets of both players are \\(\\ALPHABET A_1 = \\ALPHABET A_2 = \\{ \\mathsf{A}, \\mathsf{R} \\}\\), where \\(\\mathsf{A}\\) means that the player accepts the bargain and \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) means that the player rejects the bargain.

If \\(P_1\\) does not know that \\(P_2\\) is rational, he is liable to believe that \\(P_2\\) might choose strategy \\(\\mathsf{R}\\), in which case it would be in \\(P_1\\)’s interest to player strategy \\(\\mathsf{B}\\).\nHowever, if we postulate that\n\n\\(P_2\\) is rational, and\n\\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) is rational.\n\nThen, \\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) will not player strategy \\(\\mathsf{R}\\). However, \\(P_2\\) doesn’t know that \\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) is rational. Therefore, \\(P_2\\) doesn’t know that \\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) will not play strategy \\(\\mathsf{R}\\). Thus, we need to assume that\n\n\\(P_2\\) knows that \\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) is rational.\n\nContinuing this way, we can argue that we we need to assume that\n\n\\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) knows that \\(P_1\\) knows that \\(P_2\\) is rational.\nand so on.\n\nIf statements of this type hold for infinite depth, we say that the fact that \\(P_2\\) is rational is common knowledge. We will revisit common knowledge later in the course. For now, we assume the following.\n\n\nAssumption #\n\nIt is common knowledge that all players are rational.\n\n\n\nUnder the assumption of common knowledge of rationality, we can assume that the players will eliminate strictly dominated strategies. For example, in the previous example, both players can eliminate strategy \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) from consideration and simplify the original game \\(\\mathscr{G}\\) to game \\(\\mathscr{G}_1\\) shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{L}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{M}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{R}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{B}\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal game \\(\\mathscr{G}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{L}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{M}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathsf{B}\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced game \\(\\mathscr{G}_1\\)\n\nWe can continue this reasoning. In the reduced game \\(\\mathscr{G}_1\\), strategy \\(\\mathsf{B}\\) for \\(P_1\\) is dominated by strategy \\(\\mathsf{T}\\).

If so, we can simultaneously eliminate all of them.\nIrrespective of the order in which strategies are eliminated, IEDS gives the same simplified game.\n\n\n\nRationalizable equilibrium are derived under the assumption of common knowledge of rationality, which appears to be a benign assumption but is not. To see why common knowledge of rationality is a strong assumption, consider the following example, which is known as the beauty contest game.\nEach player picks a real number between 0 and 100. The person who was closest to the average of the group wins a prize.\nHow will you play this game?"

This is an example of a game with continuous action spaces.\nSealed bid second price auctions work as follows:\n\nAn indivisible object is for sale.\nThe set of buyers is known as \\(N\\). Each buyer \\(i\\) attaches a value \\(v_i\\) to the object, i.e., he is willing to pay at most \\(v_i\\) for the object. The value \\(v_i\\) is the buyer’s internal assessment.\nEach buyer \\(i\\) bids \\(b_i\\), presented to the auctioneer in a sealed envelop.\nThe buyer with the highest bid wins the object. If more than one buyer have the same highest bid, then the object goes to one of them at random.\nThe key feature of second price auction is that, unlike the standard auctions, the winner does not pay what he bid. Instead, he pays the second highest bid offered (and hence the name, second price auctions).\n\nHow should a rational player act in such an auction.\n\nProposition 1.1 : In sealed bid second price auctions, the bidding strategy \\(b_i = v_i\\) weakly dominates all other strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a buyer \\(i\\) with value \\(v_i\\).

Move the bid point around to see how utility function changes with the bid.\n\n\n\nNote that the curve for truthful bidding (i.e., \\(b_i = v_i\\)) weakly dominates the curves for under bidding as well as over bidding.\n\n\n\nThe rationalizability of truthful bidding holds in many situations.

    "section": "1.11 Cournot competition",
    "text": "1.11 Cournot competition\nThis is a model from economics and we will study it because of its simplicity. It is based on a model proposed by Cournot in 1839. The model describes the strategic interaction between firms in an oligopoly market (i.e., a market where a few sellers serve the entire market; both monopoly and duopoly are special cases of oligopoly).\nFormally, the Cournot competition model considers a homogeneous-goods market with \\(n\\) first. A homogeneous-goods market is a market where all firms produce a homogeneous product which are perfect substitutes (e.g., consider a commodities market such as metal or oil or electricity).\nEach firm decides how much to produce. Let \\(a_i \\in \\reals_{\\ge 0}\\) denote the production of firm \\(i\\) and \\(a = \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i\\) denote aggregate production. The price of the product depends on the aggregate production. We capture this relationship using a generic function \\(p \\colon \\reals_{\\ge 0} \\to \\reals_{\\ge 0}\\), i.e., price of product is \\(p(a)\\) when the aggregate production is \\(a\\).\nFurthermore, there is a cost \\(c\\) to produce one unit of goods. For simplicity, we assume that the cost is the same for all firms, though it is possible to consider the model this cost depends on the firm. Thus, the utility of firm \\(i\\) is \\[\n  u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) = a_i \\cdot p(a) - a_i \\cdot c.\n\\] We will analyze this game in the special case when the price function is \\[\n  p(a) = \\max \\{ M - a, 0 \\}\n\\] where \\(M\\) is the market capacity. Thus, we are assuming that prices are proportional to marginal demand.\n\nCase \\(n = 1\\)\nTo fix ideas, we consider the special case of \\(n=1\\) (i.e., a monopoly). In this case, for \\(a_1 \\in [0, M]\\), \\[\n  u_1(a_1) = a_1(M - a_1) - c a_1 = M - c -a_1) a_1.\n\\] To find the optimal value of \\(a_1\\), note that \\(u_1(a_1)\\) is concave in \\(a_1\\). Thus, we pick \\(a_1\\) such that \\(∂u_1(a_1)/∂a_1 = 0\\), i.e., \\[\n  \\frac{∂u_1(a_1)}{∂a_1} = (M - c -a_1) - a_1 = 0.\n\\] Thus, \\[\n  a_1 = \\frac{M - c}{2}\n  \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n  u_1(a_1) = \\frac{(M-c)^2}{4}.\n\\]\n\n\nCase \\(n = 2\\)\nNow, let’s consider the case when \\(n = 2\\) (a duopoly). In this case, \\[\n   u_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i( p(a_1 + a_2) - c).\n\\] Again, we can verify that for a fixed \\(a_2\\), \\(u_1(a_1, a_2)\\) is concave in \\(a_1\\) and for a fixed \\(a_1\\), \\(u_2(a_1, a_2)\\) is concave in \\(a_2\\). So, the BR can be obtained by the first order optimality condition \\(∂ u_i(a_1, a_2)/∂ a_i = 0\\).\nNote that \\[ p(a_1 + a_2) = \\begin{cases}\n    M - (a_1 + a_2), & \\text{if $a_1 + a_2 \\le M$} \\\\\n    0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\] Therefore, (ignoring the non-differentiable point \\(a_1 + a_2 = M\\)), we have \\[ \\frac{∂p(a_1 + a_2)}{∂a_i} = \\begin{cases}\n    -1, & \\text{if $a_1 + a_2 < M$} \\\\\n    0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\] So, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{∂ u_i(a_1, a_2)}{∂ a_i}\n&= p(a_1 + a_2) - c + a_i \\frac{∂ p(a_1 + a_2)}{∂ a_i} \\\\\n&= \\begin{cases}\n    M - (a_1 + a_2) - c - a_i,  & \\text{if $a_1 + a_2 \\le M$} \\\\\n    0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\\] So, if \\(a_1 + a_2 < M\\), the BR of firm 1 and firm 2 are: \\[\n  B_1(a_2) = \\frac{M - c -a_2}{2}\n  \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n  B_2(a_1) = \\frac{M - c - a_1}{2}.\n\\] We plot the BR relationships below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best response curves\n\n\n\nNow we show that the game can be simplified using the elimination of never-best response strategies.\n\nAfter first round of elimination, we have \\(\\ALPHABET A_1 = \\ALPHABET A_2 = \\left[ 0, \\frac{M-c}{2} \\right]\\).\nAfter second round of elimination, we have \\(\\ALPHABET A_1 = \\ALPHABET A_2 = \\left[ \\frac{M-c}{4}, \\frac{M-c}{4} \\right]\\).\n…\n\nContinuing this way, we can show that the process converges to the intersection point \\(\\left( \\frac{M-c}{3}, \\frac{M-c}{3} \\right)\\) with payoff \\(\\left( \\frac{(M-c)^2}{9}, \\frac{(M-c)^2}{9}\\right)\\).\nThis example shows that we can find a rationalizable strategy for continuous action games as well.\n\nRemark\n\nNote that if the firms collude and fix production to \\((M-c)/4\\) (which ensures that the total production is the same as the monopoly level), it will result in a higher price and increased profits. However, this feature depends on the assumptions of the model, some of which are unrealistic. For a more realistic market model, consider the later example of Bertrand competition, where players set prices rather than production levels."
