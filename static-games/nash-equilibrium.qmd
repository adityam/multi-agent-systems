So far we have looked at two solution concepts:

- Rationalizable strategies, which don't exist for all games

- Optimal or minmax strategies for zero-sum games.

In this section, we look at the most popular solution concept known as **Nash equilibrium** (which we will abbreviate to NE).

We start with an informal definition of NE.

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Informal definition of Nash equilibrium

A strategy profile is a NE if no player can improve its performance by unilateral deviations.
:::


The above definition can be written formally as follows.

:::{#def-Nash-equil}
A **Nash equilibrium** in pure strategies for a strategic game $\mathscr{G} = \langle N, (\ALPHABET S_i)_{i \in N}, (u_i)_{i \in N} \rangle$ is a strategy profile $s^* = (s^*_1, \dots, s^*_n) \in \ALPHABET S$ such that for each $i \in N$ the following is satisfied:
$$
  u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \ge u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*),
  \quad \forall s_i \in \ALPHABET S_i.
$$
The payoff vector $u(s^*)$ is called the **equilibrium payoff** corresponding to NE $s^*$.
:::

Another way to define NE is use **Best response correspondece** $\BR_i \colon \ALPHABET S_{-i} \rightrightarrows A_i$ defined as follows
$$
  \BR_i(s_{-i}) = \bigl\{ s_i \in \ALPHABET S_i : u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \ge u_i(τ_i, s_{-i}), \forall τ_i \in \ALPHABET S_i \bigr\}.
$$

:::{#def-Nash-equil-alt}
A strategy profile $s^* \in \ALPHABET S$ is a **Nash equilibrium** if each player is playing a best response to the strategy profile of other players, i.e., 
$$
  s_i^* \in \BR_i(s^*_{-i}), \quad \forall i \in N.
$$
:::

## Relationship with previous solution concepts

### Relationship between NE and dominant strategy equilibrium

Consider prisoner's dilemma game.

```{julia}
game(["A", "R"], ["A", "R"], [-2 0; -3 -1], [-2 -3; 0 -1], 
     caption="Prisoner's Dilemma")
```
Recall that $(\mathsf{A}, \mathsf{A})$ was the equilibrium in strongly dominated strategies. It can be easily verified that is also a Nash equillbrium. In fact, we have the following general result:

:::{#prp-NE-vs-dominant}
  Any equilibrium in strongly or weakly dominant strategy is also a Nash equilibrium.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
#### Proof

Suppose $s^* \in \ALPHABET S$ is an equilibrium in strongly or weakly dominant strategies. Then, by definition, for all players $i \in N$, we have
$$
u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}) \ge u_i(s_i, s_{-i}), 
  \quad \forall s_i \in \ALPHABET S_i, s_{-i} \in \ALPHABET S_{-i}.
$$
In particular, if we take $s_{-i} = s_{-i}^*$, we get
$$
u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \ge u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*), 
  \quad \forall s_i \in \ALPHABET S_i.
$$
Thus, $s^*$ is a Nash equilibrium.
:::

### Relationship between NE and rationalizable strategies

Recall the following example discussed earlier:

```{julia}
game(["T", "B"], ["L", "C", "R"], [1 1 0; 0 0 2], [0 2 1; 3 1 0])
```
We had shown earlier that $(\mathsf{T}, \mathsf{C})$ is a rationalizble strategy obtained by IEDS. It can be easily verified that it is also a Nash equilibrium. In fact, we have the following general result.

:::{#prp-NE-vs-rationalizable}
  Any rationalizable output come IEDS or IEWDS is a Nash equilibrium.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
#### Proof

For IEDS, the proof hinges on the fact that at each step of IEDS, we remove strategies that are dominated and therefore cannot be part of the best response. 

For IEWDS, we may remove some best response strategies, but anything that survives has to be a best response pair.
:::

### Relationship between NE and optimal strategies in zero sum games

Recall the following example discussed earlier in @exm-value-zsg

```{julia}
game1(["T", "M", "B"], ["L", "C", "R"], [2 -1 -2; 1 0 1; -2 -1 2])
```

We had shown that $(\mathsf{M}, \mathsf{C})$ is an optimal strategy of this game. It can be easily verified that it is also a Nash equilibrium. In fact, we have the following general result:

:::{#prp-NE-vs-optimal}
  Any optimal strategy of a ZSG is a NE and vice versa.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
#### Proof

This follows immediately from the saddle point property of optimal strategies.
:::


The above discussion shows that the concept of Nash equilibrium generalizes all the solution concepts that we have discussed so far. The main advantage of Nash equilibrium is that it exists even when the previously discussed solution concepts do not. For instance, consider the following games.

:::{#exm-battle-of-sexes}

Find all NE (in pure strategies) for Battle of Sexes game.

```{julia}
game(["F", "O"], ["F", "O"], [2 0; 0 1], [1 0; 0 2],
     caption="Battle of Sexes game")
```
:::

:::{#exm-chicken}

Find all NE (in pure strategies) for the game of chicken

```{julia}
game(["C", "H"], ["C", "H"], [3 1; 10 0], [3 10; 1 0],
     caption="The game of chicken")
```
:::

Note that a game may not have an equilibrium in pure strategyes. For example, the game of matching pennies has no equilibrium in pure strategies. 

```{julia}
game(["H", "T"], ["H", "T"], [1 -1; -1 1], [-1 1; 1 -1],
     caption="Matching pennies game")
```

It is natural to ask if we can seek a NE in mixed strategies in such instances. And, in general, **when does a game have a NE?**

This question was answered by [@Nash1950; @Nash1951] who showed that any finte game has a NE in mixed strategy. We will come to that proof later. 

## Computing NE in $2 × 2$ games

We start by a brute-force method to compute NE in $2 × 2$ games. This method is just for illustration. Based on the intuition from this method, we will later present an efficient method to compute NE. 

Consider the game shown below. We can check that the game has no NE in pure strategies.

```{julia}
game(["T", "B"], ["L", "R"], [1 0; 0 2], [-1 2; 1 0],
     caption="Game with no NE in pure strategies")
```
Let $σ_1 = (p, 1-p)$ and $σ_2 = (q, 1-q)$ be a NE in mixed strategies. Then, the probability distribution of the different actions is shown below:

```{julia}
game1(["T", "B"], ["L", "R"], ["pq" "p(1-q)"; "(1-p)q" "(1-p)(1-q)"],
     caption="Probability of choosing different actions")
```

Thus, we have
\begin{align*}
  U_1(p, q) \coloneqq U_1(σ_1, σ_2) &= 1 ⋅ pq + 0 ⋅ p (1-q) + 0 ⋅ (1-p) q + 2 ⋅ (1-p)(1-q) \\
  &= 3pq - 2p -2q + 2,
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
  U_2(p, q) \coloneqq U_2(σ_1, σ_2) &= -1 ⋅ pq + 2 ⋅ p (1-q) + 1 ⋅ (1-p) q + 0 ⋅ (1-p)(1-q) \\
  &= -4pq + 2p + q .
\end{align*}

Thus, we can think of this as a two player game on the unit square where $P_1$ chooses $p \in [0,1]$ and $P_2$ chooses $q \in [0,1]$ and the pageoff functions are $U_1(p, q)$ and $U_2(p,q)$, respectively. 

In this notation, NE is a point $(p,q)$ such that
$$
  p \in \BR_1(q)
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  q \in \BR_2(p).
$$

We will now identify the best response maps $\BR_1$ and $\BR_2$ and then compute the NE. 

### Best response map of player 1

Recall that
$$
  U_1(p,q) = 3 pq - 2p - 2q + 2 = (3q - 2) p - 2q + 2
$$
which is linear in $p$ (for a fixed $q$). Thus,
$$
  \max_{p \in [0,1]} U_1(p,q)
  = \begin{cases}
    U_1(1, q) = q, & \hbox{if } 3q - 2 \ge 0 \\
    U_1(0, q) = -2q + 2, & \hbox{if } 3q - 2 < 0 
  \end{cases}
$$
and
$$
  \arg\max_{p \in [0,1]} U_1(p,q)
  = \begin{cases}
    1, & \hbox{if } 3q - 2 > 0 \\
    [0,1], & \hbox{ if 3q - 2 = 0 \\
    0, & \hbox{if } 3q - 2 < 0 
  \end{cases}
$$

We can visual these results graphically, as shown in @fig-BR-1.

Best response map for player 1
:::

### Best response map of player 2

We repeat the above process for player 2. 
Recall that
$$
  U_2(p,q) = -4 pq + 2p + q = (1 - 4p)q + 2p
$$
which is linear in $q$ (for a fixed $p$). Thus,
$$
  \max_{q \in [0,1]} U_2(p,q)
  = \begin{cases}
    U_2(p, 0) =  2p, & \hbox{if } 1 - 4p \le 0 \\
    U_2(p, 1) = -2p + 1, & \hbox{if } 1 - 4p > 0 
  \end{cases}
$$
and
$$
  \arg\max_{q \in [0,1]} U_2(p,q)
  = \begin{cases}
    0, & \hbox{if } 1 - 4p < \\
    [0,1], & \hbox{ if } 1 - 4p = 0 \\
    1, & \hbox{if } 1 - 4p > 0 
  \end{cases}
$$

We can visual these results graphically, as shown in @fig-BR-2.

Best response map for player 2
:::

### Identifying the NE

To compute the NE, we look at the two BR curves and find their point of intersection, as shown in @fig-BR-cap. 

![Intersection of the best response curves of the two players. Note that the axes of the best response curve of player 2 has been flipped](figures/svg/nash-equilibrium5.svg){#fig-BR-cap}

Thus, the NE is $σ_1 = (\tfrac 14, \tfrac 34)$ and $σ_2 = (\tfrac 23, \tfrac 13)$. 

Observe that each BR curve is like a staircase. If we are looking for an equilibrium in _strictly mixed strategies_ (i.e., $p \in (0,1)$ and $q \in (0,1)$), then the intersection point of the two BR curves will be the vertically straight line part of the BR curves. 

Recall that we have argued that
$$
  \max_{p \in [0,1]} U_1(p,q) = 
  \begin{cases}
    U_1(\mathsf{T}, q), & q \ge q^* \\
    U_1(\mathsf{B}, q), & q \le q^* 
  \end{cases}
$$
where $q^*$ is the point where $U_1(\mathsf{T}, q) = U_1(\mathsf{B}, q)$. 

By a symmetric argument, we have that $p^*$ point in the BR curve for player 2 is the point where $U_2(p, \mathsf{L}) = U_2(p, \mathsf{R})$. 

Thus, instead of drawing the BR curves, we could have directly found the mixed strategy NE $(p^*, q^*)$ as
$$
  \bbox[5pt,border: 1px solid]{
    \begin{aligned}
      q^* &: q \hbox{ such that } U_1(\mathsf{T}, q) = U_1(\mathsf{B}, q) \\
      p^* &: p \hbox{ such that } U_2(p, \mathsf{R}) = U_2(p, \mathsf{B})
    \end{aligned}
  }
$$
This provides a general method of finding the NE for $2 × 2$ games, which we use in general.

game(["F", "O"], ["F", "O"], [2 0; 0 1], [1 0; 0 2],
     caption="Battle of Sexes game")
```
:::

:::{.callout-note}
#### Solution

We have already identified the pure strategy NE in @exr-battle-of-sexes. We now consider NE in strictly mixed strategies. 

Let $σ_1 = (p, 1-p)$ and $σ_2 = (q, 1-q)$ be a NE in mixed strategies. Then, the equilibrium value of $p$ is such that
$$
U_2(p, \mathsf{F}) = U_2(p, \mathsf{O}) 
$$
Hence,
$$
  p = 2 (1 - p) \implies p = \tfrac 23.
$$

Similarly, the equilibrium value of $q$ is such that
$$
  U_1(\mathsf{F}, q) = U_1(\mathsf{O}, q)
$$
Hence,
$$ 2 q = 1 - q \implies q = \tfrac 13.$$
Thus, in addition to the two pure strategy NE, we have $σ_1 = (\tfrac 23, \tfrac 13)$ and $σ_2 = (\tfrac 13, \tfrac 23)$ is a mixed strategy NE.

## The indifference principle

We now present a general method to compute NE for finite games. The method relies on the following characterization of NE.

:::{#thm-NE-property}
Let $\mathscr{G} = \langle N, (\ALPHABET S_i)_{i \in N}, (u_i)_{i \in N} \rangle$ be a finite strategic game. Then $σ^* = (σ^*_1, \dots, σ^*_n)$, where $σ^*_i \in Δ(\ALPHABET S_i)$, $i \in N$< is a mixed strategy NE of $\mathscr{G}$ [if and only if]{.text-danger} for every player $i \in N$ and every pure strategy $s_i$ in the support of $σ^*_i$ (i.e., every $s_i$ such that $σ^*_i(s_i) > 0$), we have
$$
    s_i \in \BR_i(σ^*_{-i}).
$$
:::

:::{.callout-note}
#### Proof

- $(\implies)$ Suppose there is a $s_i$ in the support of $σ^*_i$ (i.e., $σ^*_i(s_i) > 0$) but $s_i \not\in \BR_{i}(σ^*_{-i})$. Then, by linearity of $U_i(σ_i, σ^*_{-i})$ in $σ_i$, player $i$ can increase its payoff by transferring the probability mass on $s_i$ to an action that is a BR. This will imply that $σ^*_i$ is not a Br, which is a contradiction. Thus, our initial supposition must be incorrect and $s_i \in \BR_i(σ^*_{-i})$.

- $(\impliedby)$ Suppose for every player $i \in N$ and every action $s_i$ in the support of $σ^*_i$ is a BR of $σ^*_{-i}$ but $σ^*$ is not a NE. Then, there must be a player $i$ such that $σ^*_i$ is not a BR to $σ^*_{-i}$. 

  Since $σ^*_i$ is not a BR, there must be a mixed strategy $τ_i$ such that 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ineq}
      U_i(σ^*_i, σ^*_{-i}) < U_i(τ_i, σ^*_{-i}).
  \end{equation}
  Now consider a $t_i$ in the support of $τ_i$ and $s_i$ in the support of $σ^*_i$. By linearity of $U_i$, we have
  $$
    U_i(t_i, σ^*_{-i}) = U_i(τ_i, σ^*_{-i})
  $$
  and
  $$
    U_i(s_i, σ^*_{-i}) = U_i(σ^*_i, σ^*_{-i}).
  $$
  Eq. \eqref{eq:ineq} implies that $U_i(t_i, σ^*_{-i}) > U_i(s_i, σ^*_{-i})$. This means that $s_i$ is not a BR of $σ^*_{-i}$, which is a contraction. Hence, our supposition that $σ^*_i$ is not a NE must be incorrect.
:::

An immediate consequence of the previous result is the following.

:::{#thm-indifference-principle}
#### The indifference principle
  Let $σ^* = (σ^*_1, \dots, σ^*_n)$ be a NE in mixed strategy. Then, we have the following:

  - For any $s_i$ such that $σ^*_i(s_i) > 0$, we have
    $$
        U_i(s_i, σ^*_{-i}) = U_i(σ^*_i, σ^*_{-i}).
    $$

  - For any $s_i$ such that $σ^*_i(s_i) = 0$, we have
    $$
        U_i(s_i, σ^*_{-i}) \le U_i(σ^*_i, σ^*_{-i}).
    $$
:::

:::{.callout-note}
#### Proof

From @thm-NE-property, we know that every pure strategy in the support of $σ^*_i$ must be a BR to $σ^*_{-i}$ and hence all such strategies must have the same payoff. Moreover, if all the pure strategies in the support of $σ^*_i$ have the same payoff, their payoff must be the same as the payoff of $σ^*_i$. This establishes the first property.

The second property follows from the definition of NE.
:::

@thm-indifference-principle can be used to compute the NE of general two-player finite game. Let $(σ^*_1, σ^*_2)$ be a mixed strategy NE. Let
$$
  \text{supp}(σ^*_i) = \{ s_i \in \ALPHABET S_i : σ^*_i(s_i) > 0 \}
$$
denote the support of $σ^*_i$. From @thm-indifference-principle, we have that for any $s^∘_i \in \text{supp}(σ^*_i)$, $i \in \{1, 2\}$, we must have
\begin{align*}
  U_1(s^∘_1, σ^*_2) &= U_1(s_1, σ^*_2), & s_1 &\in \text{supp}(σ^*_1) \\ 
  U_1(s^∘_1, σ^*_2) &\ge U_1(t_1, σ^*_2), & t_1 &\not\in \text{supp}(σ^*_1) 
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
  U_2(σ^*_1, s^∘_2) &= U_2(σ^*_1, s_2), & s_2 &\in \text{supp}(σ^*_2) \\ 
  U_2(σ^*_1, s^∘_2) &\ge U_2(σ^*_1, t_2), & t_2 &\not\in \text{supp}(σ^*_2) 
\end{align*}

Note that for any given choice of $\text{supp}(σ^*_1)$ and $\text{supp}(σ^*_2)$, we can check if the above equations have a consistent solution. If they do, that solutin is a NE. 

The difficulty is that we do not know the support of $σ^*_1$ and $σ^*_2$. So, we need to repeat the above process for each choice of supports. Computing NE by such a brute-force search has an exponential complexity in $\ABS{\ALPHABET S_1}$ and $\ABS{\ALPHABET S_2}$.
