title: Introduction

Multi-agent decision problems are conceptually different from single agent decision problems. In a single agent decision problem, a decision maker has to choose an action $a \in \ALPHABET A$ to minimize a cost $c(a)$ (or, equivalently, receives a payoff or a utility $u(a)$). In multi-agent decision problems, different players may have different utility functions. Such settings are called **games**. We start with the simplest setting of two player games. 

Consider a decision problem where there are two players. Player 1 ($P_1$ from
now on) chooses an action $a_1 \in \ALPHABET A_1$ and player 2 ($P_2$ from now
on) chooses an action $a_2 \in \ALPHABET A_2$. Once both players have chosen
their actions, $P_1$ receives a payoff of $u_1(a_1, a_2)$ and $P_2$ receives a
payoff of $u_2(a_1,a_2)$. How should the players behave?


## Examples

We start with a few examples.

::: {.callout-note }
### Prisoner's dilemma.

Two criminals are arrested for a crime but the prosecutors have evidence to
only charge them for a lesser crime but not enough to charge them for the main
crime. The prisoners are kept in separate cells with no means to communicate.
The prosecutors simultaneously offer the following bargain to both prisoners:
serve as a witness that the other criminal committed the crime and walk free;
unless the other also confesses in which case both get sentenced. If both
criminals confess, both get a reduced sentenced for the main crime (2 years in
prison). If only one confesses, the criminal who confessed walks free while
the other gets a full sentence for the main crime (10 years in prison). If
neither prisoner takes the bargain, then both get charged for the lesser crime
(1 year in prison).

:::

This example can be modeled as a two player game as follow. The action sets of
both players are $\ALPHABET A_1 = \ALPHABET A_2 = \{ \mathsf{A}, \mathsf{R}
\}$, where $\mathsf{A}$ means that the player accepts the bargain and
$\mathsf{R}$ means that the player rejects the bargain. The utility functions
can be represented compactly as follows, which is called the _bimatrix
representation_ of the game.

### Battle of sexes

A couple wants to go out for the evening and there are two events taking
place: a football game and an opera. One person (player 1) prefers to go to the
football game while the other player (player 2) prefers to go the opera. But
they want to go together and are miserable if they go to separate events.

### Chicken (also called Hawk-Dove)

_Two drivers are headed for a single lane bridge from opposite directions. The
first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other and is called 'chicken'
(i.e., a coward). If neither swerve, both are involved in a head-on
collision._

### Matching pennies

Consider a parlour game among two players. Each player has a penny
and must secretly turn the penny to heads or tails. The players reveal their
choices simultaneously. If the pennies match (both heads or both tails),
player 1 wins. If they don't player 2 wins.

In the games described above, there is a conflict between the players. We
cannot simply assert that the players should take an action which maximizes
their utility because the utility of a player depends on the actions of other
players, who have different incentives. The objective of game theory is to
understand how to make decisions in such scenarios. 

## Modeling Strategic Games

The above examples described games between two players. General $n$-player
games can be modeled as follows.


::: {#def-strategic-games}
### Strategic game
A strategic game is described by a tuple $\mathscr{G} = \langle N, (\ALPHABET A_i)_{i \in N}, (u_i)_{i \in N} \rangle$, where

* $N$ is a (finite) set of players
* $\ALPHABET A_i$ is a non-empty set of actions for player $i$, $i \in N$. Define $\ALPHABET A = \prod_{i \in N}$ as the strategy space of the game $\mathscr{G}$. 
* $u_i \colon \ALPHABET A \to \reals$ is the utility function of player $i$, $i \in N$. 
::: 

Remarks

:   * When all $\ALPHABET A_i$ are finite, the game is called a _finite game_.
* To play the game, each player chooses a (pure) _strategy_ $a_i \in
  \ALPHABET A_i$. 
* The collection $a = (a_i)_{i \in N}$ is called the _strategy profile_.
* Given a profile $x = (x_i)_{i \in N}$ (not necessarily strategy profile,
  but any list of elements, one for each player), $x_{-i}$ denotes the
  list $(x_j)_{j \in N \setminus \{i\}}$. We will write $x = (x_i,
  x_{-i})$. 

## Dominated strategies

We now define the notion of dominance, which can be used to provide a solution
concept for some games. 

::: {#def-dominance}
### Dominance
Consider a game $\mathscr{G}$ with standard notation. Let $a_i, b_i \in \ALPHABET A_i$ be two strategies of player $i$. We say, strategy $a_i$ _strictly dominates_ $b_i$ if
$$
  u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) \mathbin{\color{red}>} u_i(b_i, a_{-i}),
  \quad \forall a_{-i} \in \ALPHABET A_{-i}.
$$
We say that $a_i$ _weakly dominates_ $b_i$ if
$$
  u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) \mathbin{\color{red}\ge} u_i(b_i, a_{-i}),
  \quad \forall a_{-i} \in \ALPHABET A_{-i}.
$$

We will also use the phrase "$b_i$ is (strongly or weakly) dominated by $a_i$" to denote the same fact. 
:::

A strategy $a_i \in \ALPHABET A_i$ is called (strongly or weakly) __dominant
strategy__ if it (strongly or weakly) dominates all other strategies $b_i \in
\ALPHABET A_i \setminus \{a_i\}$.

We now impose some assumptions on the players. 

::: highlight :::

Assumption #ass:strict

:   A rational player will not choose a strictly dominated strategy.

:::

Note that we have not formally defined rationality. That is more of a
philosophical discussion, and for the purpose of this course, we will not
present a formal definition but rather go with the colloquial meaning of the
word. 

::: highlight :::

Assumption #

:   All players in a game are rational.

:::

Irrespective of the definition of rationality, this assumption is often
violated in practice. Human decision makers are almost never rational. Even
when decisions are made by algorithms, the decisions may not be rational.
There is a whole branch of decision theory which considers players with
bounded rationality. However, in this course, we will make the simplifying
assumption that the players are rational. 

## Dominant strategy equilibrium

We now present the simplest solution concept for a game.

::: {.callout-important}
### Dominant strategy equilibrium 
Dominant Strategy equilibrium is a strategy profile in which each player is playing a dominant strategy.
:::

For example, consider the game of prisoner's dilemma. Note that, for $P_1$,
\begin{align*}
  u_1(\mathsf{A}, \cdot) &= \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \\
  u_1(\mathsf{R}, \cdot) &= \begin{bmatrix} -3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Thus $\mathsf{A}$ is a dominant strategy for $P_1$. 

Similarly, for $P_2$, 
\begin{align*}
  u_2(\cdot, \mathsf{A}) &= \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 
  & 
  u_2(\cdot, \mathsf{R}) &= \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Thus, $\mathsf{A}$ is a dominant strategy for $P_2$. 

Therefore, $(\mathsf{A}, \mathsf{A})$ is a dominant strategy equilibrium. Note
that both players play $\mathsf{A}$ even though $(\mathsf{R}, \mathsf{R})$
gives a better outcome for both of them!

--- 

A game may not have a dominant strategy equilibrium. For example,
there are no dominant strategies in the battle of sexes and matching pennies.
So, dominant strategy equilibrium is not a useful solution concept because it
does not always exist. One option is to generalize the notion of dominance as
explained next. 

## Rationalizable equilibrium

First, we return to the assumptions imposed on the players. Consider the
following game.

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{R}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$3$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Strategy $\mathsf{R}$ is strictly dominated for player 2 (by strategy
$\mathsf{M}$). So, if $P_2$ is rational, he will never choose $\mathsf{R}$.
Can we eliminate strategy $\mathsf{R}$ from consideration?

The argument is not so simple. If $P_1$ does not know that $P_2$ is rational,
he is liable to believe that $P_2$ might choose strategy $\mathsf{R}$, in
which case it would be in $P_1$'s interest to player strategy $\mathsf{B}$. 

However, if we postulate that

* $P_2$ is rational, and
* $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ is rational.

Then, $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ will not player strategy $\mathsf{R}$. However,
$P_2$ doesn't know that $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ is rational. Therefore, $P_2$
doesn't know that $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ will not play strategy $\mathsf{R}$.
Thus, we need to assume that

* $P_2$ knows that $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ is rational. 

Continuing this way, we can argue that we we need to assume that

* $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ knows that $P_1$ knows that $P_2$ is rational. 
* and so on. 

If statements of this type hold for infinite depth, we say that the fact that
$P_2$ is rational is __common knowledge__. We will revisit common knowledge
later in the course. For now, we assume the following.

::: highlight :::

Assumption #

:  It is common knowledge that all players are rational.

:::

Under the assumption of common knowledge of rationality, we can assume that
the players will eliminate strictly dominated strategies. For example, in the
previous example, both players can eliminate strategy $\mathsf{R}$ from
consideration and simplify the original game $\mathscr{G}$ to game
$\mathscr{G}_1$ shown below. 

<table class="game" align="center">

    <td>$3$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<figcaption>
Reduced game $\mathscr{G}_1$
</figcaption>

We can continue this reasoning. In the reduced game $\mathscr{G}_1$, strategy
$\mathsf{B}$ for $P_1$ is dominated by strategy $\mathsf{T}$. So, we obtain
the reduced game $\mathscr{G}_2$ shown below.

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<figcaption>
Reduced game $\mathscr{G}_2$
</figcaption>

Finally, we can eliminate strategy $\mathsf{L}$ for $P_1$, which is strictly
dominated by $\mathsf{M}$ to obtain game $\mathscr{G}_3$ shown below.

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<figcaption>
Reduced game $\mathscr{G}_3$
</figcaption>

This procedure is called **IEDS (Iterative elimination of dominated
strategies)**. If the procedure gives a unique strategy, that strategy is
called a **rationalizable strategy**.

Remarks

:  * In general, IEDS may not lead to a solution (i.e., we may be left with a
game which is not $1 × 1$ where no strategy is dominated). 
* At each step, there may be more than one strictly dominated strategy. If
 so, we can simultaneously eliminate all of them. 
* Irrespective of the order in which strategies are eliminated, IEDS gives
 the same simplified game. 


Rationalizable equilibrium are derived under the assumption of common
knowledge of rationality, which appears to be a benign assumption but is not.
To see why common knowledge of rationality is a strong assumption, consider
the following example, which is known as the _beauty contest game_.

_Each player picks a real number between 0 and 100. The person who was closest
to the average of the group wins a prize_. 

How will you play this game?
    
## Iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies

We can extend the notion of IEDS to IE**W**DS (Iterative elimination of
_weakly_ dominated strategies) if we make the following assumption.

::: highlight :::

Assumption #ass:weak

:  A rational player never plays a weakly dominated strategy.

:::

@ass:weak is less compelling than @ass:strict. Nonetheless, it allows us to
find solutions of games where IEDS doesn't work (see the second price auction
example below). If IEWDS gives us a unique solution, we call the resulting
strategy as a **rationalizable strategy**


However, unlike IEDS where the order of elimination of
strategies does not matter, in IEWDS we can end up with different games
depending on the order of elimination of strategies. For example, consider the
following game:

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{R}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that both strategies $\mathsf{L}$ and $\mathsf{R}$ are weakly dominated
by $\mathsf{M}$. 

If we eliminate $\mathsf{L}$, we obtain the following reduction.

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{R}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, for $P_1$, strategy $\mathsf{T}$ is dominated by strategy $\mathsf{B}$.
Eliminating $\mathsf{T}$ we get

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{R}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<figcaption>Game $\mathscr{G}_L$</figcaption>

If we eliminate $\mathsf{R}$ in the original game, we get the following
reduction.
<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here, for $P_1$, strategy $\mathsf{B}$ is weakly dominated by strategy
$\mathsf{T}$. Eliminating $\mathsf{B}$, we get

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<figcaption>Game $\mathscr{G}_R$</figcaption>

Note that games $\mathscr{G}_L$ and $\mathscr{G}_R$ cannot be reduced further.
The resulting payoffs are also different.

## Second price auction

We will study auctions in detail later in the course, but here we use the
concept of dominance to identify a rationalizable strategy in what are
knows as sealed bid, second price auctions. This is an example of a game with
continuous action spaces. 

Sealed bid second price auctions work as follows:

* An indivisible object is for sale. 
* The set of buyers is known as $N$. Each buyer $i$ attaches a value $v_i$ to
  the object, i.e., he is willing to pay at most $v_i$ for the object. The
  value $v_i$ is the buyer's internal assessment.
* Each buyer $i$ bids $b_i$, presented to the auctioneer in a sealed envelop.
* The buyer with the highest bid wins the object. If more than one buyer have
  the same highest bid, then the object goes to one of them at random.
* The key feature of second price auction is that, unlike the standard auctions,
  the winner does not pay what he bid. Instead, he pays the second highest bid
  offered (and hence the name, second price auctions). 

How should a rational player act in such an auction. 

::: {#prp-2nd-price-weakly-dominant}
: In sealed bid second price auctions, the bidding strategy $b_i = v_i$ weakly
dominates all other strategies.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
Consider a buyer $i$ with value $v_i$. Given a bid profile $b = (b_j)_{j \in
N}$, let 

* $B_{-i}$ be the highest bid by buyers other than $i$.
* $N_{-i}$ be the number of buyers (excluding $i$) who bid $B_{-i}$

Then, the payoff to player $i$ is
$$
u_i(b) = \begin{cases}
  0, & \text{if $b_i < B_{-i}$} \\
  \dfrac{v_i - B_{-i}}{N_{-i} + 1}, & \text{if $b_i = B_{-i}$} \\
  v_i - B_{-i}, & \text{if $b_i > B_{-i}$}
\end{cases}$$

Divide the set of strategies $\ALPHABET A_i = [0, ∞)$ into three sets:

* Under bid, i.e., bid less than $v_i$: i.e., the set $[0, v_i)$.
* Bid truthfully, bid equal to $v_i$: i.e., the set $\{v_i\}$.
* Over bid, i.e., bid greater than $v_i$, i.e., the set $(v_i,∞)$. 

We now plot the payoff for the cases separately:

<figure>
<div style="width:600px;height:400px;display:block; align:center;" 
     id="applet_container"></div>
<figcaption>The plot of $u_i(b_i, B_{-i})$ for a fixed value of bid $b_i$.
Move the bid point around to see how utility function changes with 
the bid.</figcaption>
</figure>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var params = {
      filename: "/stochastic-control/geogebra/games/second-price-auction.ggb",
      enableShiftDragZoom: false,
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    }

    var applet = new GGBApplet(params, true);

    window.onload = function() {
        applet.inject('applet_container');
    }
</script>

Note that the curve for truthful bidding (i.e., $b_i = v_i$) weakly dominates
the curves for under bidding as well as over bidding. 
::: 

The rationalizability of truthful bidding holds in many situations. More on
that later. 

## Dominance by mixed strategies

Consider a strategic game $\mathscr{G} = \langle N, (\ALPHABET A_i)_{i \in N},
(u_i)_{i \in N} \rangle$ where $\ALPHABET A_i = \{a_{i1}, \dots, a_{ik}\}$.
Then a mixed strategy for player $i$ is a probability distribution
$$
  α_i = (α_{i1}, \dots, α_{ik}),
  \quad
  α_{i\ell} \in [0,1],
  \quad
  \sum_{\ell=1}^k α_{i\ell} = 1
$$
over the (pure) strategies of player $i$. 

For example, suppose $\ALPHABET A = \{1,2,3\}$ and $α_i = (0.2, 0.3, 0.5)$.
This means that player $i$ chooses action $1$ with probability $0.2$, action
$2$ with probability $0.3$, and action $3$ with probability $0.5$. 

When other players are playing pure strategies $a_{-i}$ and player $i$ is
playing a mixed strategy $α_i$, then the **expected payoff** to player $i$ is
$$
  U_i(α_i, a_{-i}) = \sum_{\ell=1}^k α_{i\ell} u_i(a_{i\ell}, a_{-i}).
$$

For example, consider the matching pennies game where $α_1 = (p, 1-p)$. Then,

\begin{align*}
U_1(α_1, H) &= p - (1-p) = 2p - 1, \\
U_1(α_1, T) &= -q + (1-p) = 1 - 2p.
\end{align*}

We can think of a mixed strategy as a _virtual row_ or _virtual column_ in the
bimatrix representation of the game as follows:

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{H}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{T}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{H}$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$-1$</td>
    <td>$-1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$-1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$-1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$α_1$</td>
    <td>$2q-1$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$1-2q$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We will revisit mixed strategies later in the course. For now, we will simply
use the idea of mixed strategies to extend the notion of IEDS and IEWDS. For
example consider the game shown below (where $\bullet$ means that the value is
not specified because it is not important for the discussion)

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{R}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$3$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$3$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that none of the strategies of $P_2$ are dominated. However, if we
consider the mixed strategy $α_2 = (0.5, 0, 0.5)$, then

$$ U_2(\cdot, α_2) = \begin{bmatrix} 1.5 \\ 1.5 \end{bmatrix} $$
which dominates $\mathsf{M}$. So we can eliminate strategy $\mathsf{M}$. 

## Never best response

::: {.callout-note }
### Best Response
The best response (in pure strategies) of player $i$ to strategy profile $a_{-i}$ is a strategy $a_i$ that yields the highest utility, i.e.,
$$
  u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) \ge u_i(b_i, a_{-i}), \quad \forall b_i \in \ALPHABET
  A_i.
$$
We say that $a_i$ is _strongly_ best response if the inequality is strict
for all $b_i \neq a_i$. 
::: 

An idea related to dominance is never best response. 

::: {.callout-note } 
### Never best response

A pure strategy $a_i$ is never best response if for all mixed strategies $α_{-i}$ there exists a mixed strategy $α_i$ such that
 $$ U_i(α_i, α_{-i}) > U_i(a_i, α_{-i}). $$
:::

Let's reconsider the game discussed above

<table class="game" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{L}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{M}$</td>
    <td colspan="2">$\mathsf{R}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{T}$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$3$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\mathsf{B}$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$\bullet$</td>
    <td>$3$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now consider a mixed strategy $α_1 = (p, 1-p)$ for player 1. Then, the payoff
to player 2 is
$$ U_2(α_1, \cdot) = \begin{bmatrix} 3p & 1 & 3(1-p) \end{bmatrix} $$

Note that $\max\{ 3p, 3(1-p) \} \ge \frac 32$. Thus, for all values of $p$,
either $\mathsf{L}$ or $\mathsf{R}$ is better than $M$. 

We can generalize IEDS to eliminate neverBR strategies to obtain
rationalizable strategies (in some cases). 

## Relationship between dominated strategies and never BR strategies

By definition, a strictly dominated strategy is never BR. In general, the
converse is not true when there are more than 3 players. We illustrate this
via an example.

Consider the following three player game. Player one is the row player, player
2 is the column player, and player 3 chooses the game matrix. We only show the
payoffs for player 3.

#### Proof 
Let $α_1 = [p 1-p]$ and $α_2 = [q 1-q]$ be strategies for $P_1$ and $P_2$,
respectively. Then,
\begin{align*}
  U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{W}) &= 8pq \\
  U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{X}) &= 4pq + 4(1-p)(1-q) = 8pq + 4 - 4(p+q) \\
  U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{Y}) &= 8(1-p)(1-q) = 8 + 8pq - 8(p+q) \\
  U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{Z}) &= 3 
\end{align*}

If there is some $α_1$ and $α_2$ such that $\mathsf{X}$ is a BR to $(α_1,
α_2)$, then,
\begin{align}
   u_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{X}) \ge U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{W}) 
   &\implies
   8pq + 4 - 4(p+q) \ge 8pq
   \label{eq:1}
   \\
   u_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{X}) \ge U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{Y}) 
   &\implies
   8pq + 4 - 4(p+q) \ge 8 + 8pq - 8 (p+q)
   \label{eq:2}
   \\
   u_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{X}) \ge U_3(α_1, α_2, \mathsf{Z}) 
   &\implies
   8pq + 4 - 4(p+q) \ge 3
   \label{eq:3}
\end{align}   
  
Eq. \\eqref{eq:1} and \\eqref{eq:2} imply that $p+q = 1$. From AM-GM
inequality, we know that 
$$
 pq \le \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2 = \frac 14.
$$
Therefore, Eq. \\eqref{eq:3} cannot be satisfied.

## Cournot competition

This is a model from economics and we will study it because of its simplicity.
It is based on a model proposed by Cournot in 1839. The model describes the
strategic interaction between firms in an oligopoly market (i.e., a market
where a few sellers serve the entire market; both monopoly and duopoly are
special cases of oligopoly). 

Formally, the Cournot competition model considers a _homogeneous-goods_ market
with $n$ first. A homogeneous-goods market is a market where all firms produce
a homogeneous product which are perfect substitutes (e.g., consider a
commodities market such as metal or oil or electricity). 

Each firm decides how much to produce. Let $a_i \in \reals_{\ge 0}$ denote the
production of firm $i$ and $a = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i$ denote aggregate
production. The price of the product depends on the aggregate production. We
capture this relationship using a generic function $p \colon \reals_{\ge 0}
\to \reals_{\ge 0}$, i.e., price of product is $p(a)$ when the aggregate
production is $a$. 

Furthermore, there is a cost $c$ to produce one unit of goods. For simplicity,
we assume that the cost is the same for all firms, though it is possible to
consider the model this cost depends on the firm. Thus, the utility of firm
$i$ is
$$
  u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) = a_i \cdot p(a) - a_i \cdot c.
$$
We will analyze this game in the special case when the price function is 
$$
  p(a) = \max \{ M - a, 0 \}
$$
where $M$ is the market capacity. Thus, we are assuming that prices are
proportional to marginal demand. 

#### Case $n = 1$ {-}
To fix ideas, we consider the special case of $n=1$ (i.e., a monopoly). In
this case, for $a_1 \in [0, M]$, 
$$
  u_1(a_1) = a_1(M - a_1) - c a_1 = M - c -a_1) a_1.
$$
To find the optimal value of $a_1$, note that $u_1(a_1)$ is concave in $a_1$.
Thus, we pick $a_1$ such that $∂u_1(a_1)/∂a_1 = 0$, i.e., 
$$
  \frac{∂u_1(a_1)}{∂a_1} = (M - c -a_1) - a_1 = 0.
$$
Thus,
$$
  a_1 = \frac{M - c}{2}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  u_1(a_1) = \frac{(M-c)^2}{4}.
$$

#### Case $n = 2$ {-}

Now, let's consider the case when $n = 2$ (a duopoly). In this case,
$$
   u_i(a_1, a_2) = a_i( p(a_1 + a_2) - c).
$$
Again, we can verify that for a fixed $a_2$, $u_1(a_1, a_2)$ is concave in
$a_1$ and for a fixed $a_1$, $u_2(a_1, a_2)$ is concave in $a_2$. So, the BR
can be obtained by the first order optimality condition $∂ u_i(a_1, a_2)/∂ a_i
= 0$. 

Note that
$$ p(a_1 + a_2) = \begin{cases}
    M - (a_1 + a_2), & \text{if $a_1 + a_2 \le M$} \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
Therefore, (ignoring the non-differentiable point $a_1 + a_2 = M$), we have
$$ \frac{∂p(a_1 + a_2)}{∂a_i} = \begin{cases}
    -1, & \text{if $a_1 + a_2 < M$} \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
So,
\begin{align*}
\frac{∂ u_i(a_1, a_2)}{∂ a_i} 
&= p(a_1 + a_2) - c + a_i \frac{∂ p(a_1 + a_2)}{∂ a_i} \\
&= \begin{cases}
    M - (a_1 + a_2) - c - a_i,  & \text{if $a_1 + a_2 \le M$} \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
So, if $a_1 + a_2 < M$, the BR of firm 1 and firm 2 are:
$$
  B_1(a_2) = \frac{M - c -a_2}{2}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  B_2(a_1) = \frac{M - c - a_1}{2}.
$$
We plot the BR relationships below.

<div style="width:600px;height:400px;display:block; align:center;" 
     id="applet_container_2"></div>
<figcaption>The best response curves</figcaption>
</figure>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var params = {
      filename: "/stochastic-control/geogebra/games/Cournot Competition.ggb",
      enableShiftDragZoom: false,
      width: 600,
      height: 400,
    }

    var applet = new GGBApplet(params, true);

    window.onload = function() {
        applet.inject('applet_container_2');
    }
</script>


Now we show that the game can be simplified using the elimination of
never-best response strategies. 

* After first round of elimination, we have $\ALPHABET A_1 = \ALPHABET A_2 = 
\left[ 0, \frac{M-c}{2} \right]$. 
* After second round of elimination, we have $\ALPHABET A_1 = \ALPHABET A_2 = 
\left[ \frac{M-c}{4}, \frac{M-c}{4} \right]$. 
* ...

Continuing this way, we can show that the process converges to the
intersection point $\left( \frac{M-c}{3}, \frac{M-c}{3} \right)$ with payoff
$\left( \frac{(M-c)^2}{9}, \frac{(M-c)^2}{9}\right)$. 

This example shows that we can find a rationalizable strategy for continuous
action games as well. 

Remark

:  Note that if the firms collude and fix production to $(M-c)/4$ (which
ensures that the total production is the same as the monopoly level), it will
result in a higher price and increased profits. However, this feature depends
on the assumptions of the model, some of which are unrealistic. For a more
realistic market model, consider the later example of Bertrand competition,
where players set prices rather than production levels.
