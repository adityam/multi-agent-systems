# About the course {.unnumbered}

These are lecture notes for ECSE 508 (Multi-Agent Systems) that I teach in the Winter term of every odd year. These notes are not meant to be exhaustive; rather my focus is to convey the key ideas in their simplest form. For a more exhaustive treatment of the subject, please refer to the reference books mentioned below.

If you find any typos/mistakes in the notes, please let me know. [Pull requests are welcome](https://github.com/adityam/multi-agent-systems).
